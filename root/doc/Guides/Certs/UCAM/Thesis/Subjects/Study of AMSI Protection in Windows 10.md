#### Description

This Master's Thesis will involve a comprehensive study of the AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) protection in Windows. The project will explain what AMSI is, how it works, what it protects against, and the techniques available to bypass it.

One of the main objectives is to implement different bypass techniques to circumvent this protection in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 environments.

#### Milestones and Objectives

1. **Explain the state of the art** of this Windows protection, specifically for Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, and Windows Server 2019. This includes research into AMSI and its areas of operation. While it may seem initially tied to PowerShell, further investigation will reveal its broader functionality.
2. **Explain AMSI's functionality at a low level**, detailing how antivirus (AV) software interacts with AMSI and how other protections integrate with it.
3. **Study bypass techniques** and implement a tool that compiles some of the studied techniques.
4. **Demonstrate the effectiveness** of the implemented techniques through testing with the tool.
5. **Programming language:** The choice of language is up to the student. They may use any language they are most comfortable with.
