#### Description

This Master's Thesis will involve studying and developing a procedure for addressing privilege escalation in Windows systems.

One of the objectives is to create a structured methodology for privilege escalation in Windows systems based on:

- **Operating system version** (e.g., Windows 7, 8, 8.1, or 10), including analogous Windows Server versions.
- **Update level** of the operating system.
- **Known techniques** available to the student, applicable depending on the scenario.

The goal is to develop a **rule-based system** that, given specific inputs, determines the appropriate privilege escalation technique to use. The final objective is to create a small tool that, by answering specific questions, can recommend the best technique for privilege escalation.

Historically, this type of problem could be tackled using systems like **CLIPS** or other rule-based programming languages, which are foundational to what we now know as **Artificial Intelligence** or expert systems.

#### Milestones and Objectives

1. **Explain the state of the art** in privilege escalation, aiming to classify existing techniques.
2. **Study privilege escalation techniques** and their applicability.
3. **Develop a tool** to assist pentesters by asking targeted questions to determine the best technique. This could be implemented using tools such as Excel or programming languages like CLIPS, Python, or others.
4. **Demonstrate the effectiveness** of the implemented tool through testing.
