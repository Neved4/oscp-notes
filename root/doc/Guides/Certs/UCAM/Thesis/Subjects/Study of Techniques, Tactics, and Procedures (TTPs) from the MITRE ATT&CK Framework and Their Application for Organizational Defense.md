#### Description

This Master's Thesis will focus on studying the MITRE ATT&CK framework and the TTPs it encompasses. The techniques, tactics, and procedures reflected in the framework illustrate how adversaries or threats operate on the internet. Understanding the framework enables organizations to determine the protective measures necessary to mitigate these TTPs against their systems.

One of the objectives of this project is to propose a guide of best practices for implementing protections and controls in various environments. By analyzing the ATT&CK framework and selecting a specific environment (e.g., Cloud, IoT, OT, etc.), the student will propose controls to counteract known threats.

In other words, the student will develop a guide of best practices for applying controls in the chosen environment (e.g., Cloud, IoT, or another selected option) to address the TTPs detailed in the ATT&CK framework.

#### Milestones and Objectives

The proposed milestones and objectives for this Master's Thesis are as follows:

1. **Explain the state of the art** of the ATT&CK framework and the Shield solution.
2. **Identify necessary controls** for a specific environment (e.g., Cloud, IoT, OT, etc.).
3. **Detail the controls** and describe how they counteract the MITRE TTPs.
4. **Demonstrate effectiveness** through fictitious use cases, showing that the proposed controls can be applied to mitigate threats.
