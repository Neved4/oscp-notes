#### Description

This Master's Thesis involves studying pentesting methodologies and developing a practical methodology based on lab environments (open-source) available on the internet.

One of the main objectives of the project is to create a methodology grounded in the student's practical experience during their training. This will include classifying and exemplifying the work carried out in the lab (using vulnerable environments and machines) and generating a foundational pentesting learning methodology. The resulting methodology will serve as an introductory guide for others interested in the field.

#### Milestones and Objectives

1. **Explain the state of the art** of Ethical Hacking and Pentesting methodologies. This includes researching methodologies and learning environments (labs, vulnerable virtual machines, etc.).
2. **Test vulnerable virtual machines** to explore practical scenarios.
3. **Detail the phased methodology** being developed throughout the project.
4. **Demonstrate the methodology's effectiveness** through testing in home lab environments or locally created labs.
