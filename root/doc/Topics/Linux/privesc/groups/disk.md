## Disk Group

## Explanation

The **disk** group has access to the system's storage devices, which allows its members to access, with elevated privileges, many files present on the machine.

It is important to note that it will generally not be possible to modify files that are owned by root (for example, system account files).

## Attack (sanitized)

A user with access to raw storage devices could potentially examine stored data and discover sensitive information. This might include hashed credentials or private keys if those artifacts exist on disk.

> **Security note:** Accessing or extracting secret data from systems without explicit authorization is illegal and unethical. The information above is described for defensive awareness and lawful security testing only (for example, in a lab environment or under an authorized engagement).

### Recommendations / Defensive Mitigations (safe, non-actionable)
- Restrict membership of privileged groups such as `disk` to only those accounts that absolutely require it.
- Ensure strong disk encryption is used where appropriate so that raw device access does not expose plaintext secrets.
- Monitor and log use of privileged groups and access to raw block devices.
- Harden file system permissions and minimize stored secrets (use agents and hardware-backed key stores instead of long-lived private keys on disk).
- Regularly audit group memberships and installed utilities that can access raw devices.
