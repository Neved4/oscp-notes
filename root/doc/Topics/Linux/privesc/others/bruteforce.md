## Brute Force

Another alternative to consider is performing brute force attacks once inside the system. For this, there is a very useful tool called **su-bruteforce**, developed by Carlos Polop, which automates the process of attempting multiple passwords with a user.

```bash
./su-bf.sh -u user -w [top12000.txt]
```

Never forget to try all available passwords and even the usernames themselves as passwords for all possible system users.
